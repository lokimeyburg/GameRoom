GameRoom is a very simple Rails app to showcase [Stacker](https://github.com/lokimeyburg/Stacker), an iOS view-controller to make building hybrid native/web iOS apps much simpler.

Here's what it looks like running inside Stacker:

## Setup

Make sure your machine has Ruby 2 and Rails 4. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lokimeyburg/GameRoom.git
$ cd GameRoom
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```

Now check `http://localhost:3000` and you should see GameRoom running in your browser.
